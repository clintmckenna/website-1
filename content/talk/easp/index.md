**About:** In May 2019, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the 2019 [Technology and Relationships Conference](https://techandrelationships.org/), supported by the European Association of Social Psychology, Facebook, AdopteUnMec, APA Science Directorate, Eris Enterprises, and EmbrLabs. The conference was held in stunning Annecy, France. 

During my talk, I described one of my current research projects examining interpersonal confrontation on social media. If you would like to see my full slide deck, please don't hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:susac@umich.edu?Subject=slides) and I would be happy to share them with you.
