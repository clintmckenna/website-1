**Abstract:** 

Fruit and vegetable consumption is crucial for managing a health weight (Rolls et al., 2004) and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (Ness & Fowles, 1997). Yet only about 10 percent of adults consume the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables (Lee-Kwan et al., 2017). How can we increase healthy food purchasing? Research by Turnwald et al. (2017) found that vegetables described indulgently were more frequently consumed. In the current study, we explored whether describing healthy foods as appetizing (versus healthy) interacted with priming people to an action or inaction goal (a framework described by Albarracin & Handley, 2011) in changing attitudes about an intentions to buy healthy foods. Preliminary results (N = 115) after conducting a two-way ANCOVA revealed a significant interaction of food description and general action and inaction goals on likelihood of eating (p = 0.0258) and buying (p = 0.0376) healthy foods, such that framing the food as appetizing after an action prime lead to increased intent to eat and buy these foods.
